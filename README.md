# Overview 

This analysis is for an upcoming business based in Oahu, Hawaii, looking to open a surf n' shake shop providing services related to surfing and serving ice cream at the same time. The idea came about when an upcoming businessman Wyan was in Hawaii and discovered he has a passion for surfing. Wyan has teamed up with a well-known investor W. Avy who has first-hand experience in a surf shop business. W. Avy's first surf shop was unsuccessful because he forgot to account for the weather. This time he has incorporated weather analysis to ensure he does not make the same mistake. W. Avy was able to get a weather dataset for Oahu, Hawaii. Using this dataset focused on temperature data for June and December in Oahu, it is plausible that a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results 

The result of the analysis for June and December are as followed, but the results are summarized using statistics terms. Here's a refresher on key concepts in statistics shown in the analysis. 

 * Count: is simply the count of how many items or "observations" you have.
 * Mean: (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. 
 * Std: (standard deviation) is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 
 * Min: (Minimum) is the smallest number in a dataset.
 * 25%: (the first quartile) is the middle number between the smallest number (minimum) and the data set's median. 
 * 50%: (The second quartile)is the median of a data set; thus, 50% of the data lies below this point.
 * 75%: (The third quartile) is the middle value between the median and the highest value (maximum) of the data set.  
 * Max: (Maximum) is the largest number in a dataset.
