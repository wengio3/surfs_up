# Overview 

This analysis is for an upcoming business based in Oahu, Hawaii, looking to open a surf n' shake shop providing services related to surfing and surviving ice cream at the same time. The idea came about when an upcoming business Wyan was in Hawaii and discovered he has a passion for surfing. Wyan has teamed up with a well-known investor W. Avy who has first-hand experience in a surf shop business. W. Avy's first surf shop was unsuccessful because he forgot to account for the weather so this time determined not to make the same unfortunate mistake again. W. Avy was able to get a weather dataset for Oahu, Hawaii. So using this dataset, this analysis finds out that the weather will not cause a problem for this upcoming business.
