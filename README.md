# Overview 

This analysis is for an upcoming business based in Oahu, Hawaii, looking to open a surf n' shake shop providing services related to surfing and surviving ice cream at the same time. The idea came about when an upcoming business Wyan was in Hawaii and discovered he has a passion for surfing. Wyan has teamed up with a well-known investor W. Avy who has first-hand experience in a surf shop business. W. Avy's first surf shop was unsuccessful because he forgot to account for the weather so this time determined not to make the same unfortunate mistake again. W. Avy was able to get a weather dataset for Oahu, Hawaii. So using this dataset, this analysis focused on temperature data for June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results 

The result of the analysis for June and December are as followed, but the results are summarized using statistics terms. Here's a refresher on key concepts in statistics shown in the analysis. 

 * Count: count is simply the count of how many items or "observations" you have.
 * means: mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest.
 * Std: standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 
 * Min: Minimum: the smallest number in a dataset.
 * 25%: the first quartile (Q1) is the middle number between the smallest number (minimum) and the data set's median. It is also known as the lower or 25th empirical quartile, as 25% of the data is below this point.
 * 50%: The second quartile (Q2) is the median of a data set; thus, 50% of the data lies below this point.
 * 75%: The third quartile (Q3) is the middle value between the median and the highest value (maximum) of the data set. It is known as the upper or 75th empirical quartile, as 75% of the data lies below this point. 
 * Max: Maximum: the largest number in a dataset.
